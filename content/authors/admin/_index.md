Welcome to my webpage! I'm a PhD candidate in Economics at the [Zurich Graduate School of Economics](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en/study/phd/zurichgse.html) (University of Zurich). I hold a MSc and a BSc in Economics from the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en/homepage). My research interests are Macroeconomics and Labor Economics. In my research I study the factors that prevent economies from reaching full employment and how governments can intervene to address them.
