abstract: The study quantitatively and qualitatively examines the use of COVID-19 short-time work from March 2020 to June 2022 and its economic effects. Short-time work contributed significantly to stabilising employment, although one-third of the subsidised jobs would have continued to exist even without short-time work (windfall effect). At the individual level, workers whose employment was maintained through short-time work remained better integrated into the labour market afterwards than comparable workers who became unemployed due to the pandemic. The qualitative part highlights implementation experiences and develops reform options and strategies for future use, focusing on developing a "blueprint" for a possible mass use of short-time work.
