abstract: We study the role of firms' market power in the equilibrium effects of the minimum wage. On the one hand, higher minimum wages compress firms' labor market power by increasing workers' reservation wage. On the other hand, they boosts firms' product market power by inducing workers' reallocation from small to larger firms, which increase their market shares and raise their price markups as a result. We call this novel mechanism "concentration channel" of the minimum wage. We show that both the labor share and the GDP response to the minimum wage depend on which effect dominates. To quantify the net market power response, we construct a novel structural model with frictional labor markets and oligopolistically-competitive product markets, which generate endogenous markdowns and markups. We estimate the model on Italian social security data replicating key labor market statistics for different worker types and the detailed structure of sectoral product markets. We find that both the labor share and GDP are hump-shaped in the level of minimum wage. We compute the optimal minimum wage that trades off productivity gains from workers' reallocation against employment losses from higher labor costs. Our results stress the importance of factoring in firms' total market power for a correct evaluation of minimum wage reforms.
