abstract: We study the equilibrium and welfare effects of the minimum wage when product market power is endogenous and varies with market competition. A higher minimum wage reallocates workers from small to large firms. Large firms gain market share and increase their price markups. We call this mechanism ``concentration channel" of the minimum wage. We contribute an equilibrium model with frictional labor markets and  oligopolistic product markets. We estimate the model on Italian administrative data, replicating the structure of detailed labor and product markets. We find that both the aggregate labor share and consumption are hump-shaped in the minimum wage, due to the opposing responses of price markups and wage markdowns. The optimal minimum wage directly affects 10% of workers. Endogenous product market power lowers the optimal minimum wage. We provide empirical evidence supporting the concentration channel.

# We study the equilibrium effects of the minimum wage when product market power is endogenous and varies with market competition. A higher minimum wage reallocates workers from small to large firms. Large firms gain market share and increase their price markups. We call this mechanism "concentration channel" of the minimum wage. We contribute a model with frictional labor markets, to allow for worker reallocation, and  oligopolistic product markets,  to account for the response of price markups. We estimate the model on Italian social security data, replicating the structure of detailed labor and product markets. Our counterfactuals suggest that both the aggregate labor share and value added are hump-shaped in the minimum wage, due to the opposing responses of price markups and wage markdowns. The optimal minimum wage, which trades off reallocation gains against employment losses, equals 70% of the current median wage. If product market power were exogenous, both the optimal minimum wage and the associated welfare gains would be higher. We provide novel empirical evidence from Italian firms supporting the concentration channel.

# We study the role of endogenous product market power in driving the equilibrium effects of the minimum wage. A higher minimum wage induces workers' reallocation towards large firms, which increase their price markups as they gain market shares. We call this novel mechanism ``concentration channel" of the minimum wage. We build a novel structural model with frictional labor markets and oligopolistically-competitive product markets, which features endogenous markdowns and markups. We estimate the model on Italian social security data replicating the empirical wage distributions for each industry and worker skill type, as well as the concentration of detailed product markets. We find that both the aggregate labor share and value added are hump-shaped in the minimum wage size, owing to the countervailing response of markups and markdowns. We compute the optimal minimum wage, which trades off reallocation gains against employment losses from higher labor costs and markups. The optimal minimum wage in Italy equals 60% of the current median wage and induces welfare gains of 0.4% consumption equivalent units. Without endogenous product market power, the optimal wage would be higher and induce double welfare gains. Reduced-form evidence from Italian firms shows that the concentration channel matters for the firm-level adjustment to the minimum wage.
# We study the role of firms' market power in the equilibrium effects of the minimum wage. A higher minimum wage compresses labor market power by increasing workers' reservation wage. On the other hand, it boosts product market power by reallocating market shares towards large firms, which raise price markups. We call this novel mechanism "concentration channel" of the minimum wage. To quantify the net market power response, we construct a novel structural model with frictional labor markets and oligopolistically-competitive product markets, which generate endogenous markdowns and markups. We estimate the model on Italian social security data replicating key labor market statistics for different worker types and the detailed structure of sectoral product markets. We find that both the aggregate labor share and output are hump-shaped in the minimum wage size. We compute the optimal minimum wage when firms have market power, which trades off productivity gains from workers' reallocation against employment losses from higher labor costs. The optimal minimum wage induces welfare gains from 0.7 to 2.3% consumption equivalent units, depending on the completeness of asset markets.
